"AI Smart Four-Wheel Drive Car" project:
Project Overview
The project is built on the Raspberry Pi 5 platform, integrating a high-precision camera, a four-wheel-drive chassis, visual SLAM, voice interaction, and web remote control. The solution includes real-time mapping, web display, and precise camera gimbal control using PWM signals.

Core Features
Web Control: Utilize WebSocket and Flask API for remote control, supporting virtual joysticks for car and camera gimbal operation.
Real-time Video Transmission: Implement WebRTC with a HUANER wide-angle camera for low-latency HD video streaming.
Four-Motor Control: Use the LOBOROBOT function library for precise car movement control.
AI Autonomous Navigation: Integrate ORB-SLAM3 for real-time environment mapping and path planning.
Real-time Map Construction: Process SLAM data to construct a 2D/3D map of the environment.
Web Map Display: Use JavaScript libraries like Leaflet or Three.js to render the map on the web interface.
Camera Gimbal Control: Implement PWM9 and PWM10 for horizontal and vertical gimbal control, respectively.

Hardware Structure
Computing Unit: Raspberry Pi 5 for controlling car movement, voice interaction, and web interface.
Camera: HUANER USB 160° 4K for high-resolution video and mapping data.
Chassis: Four-Wheel Drive Chassis for versatile movement;set speed less than 30;
Servo Gimbal: MG996R + PCA9685 for camera orientation.
Horizontal Control: PWM9, initial angle 80°, range ±45°.
Vertical Control: PWM10, initial angle 40°, range ±45°.
MPU6050: IMU Sensor for positioning and navigation.

Software System
Operating System: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
Core Control Program: LOBOROBOT.py for car movement control.
Mapping and Navigation: ORB-SLAM3 for real-time mapping and navigation.
Web Interface: Flask API with WebSocket for real-time data transmission and control.

Web Control Interface Design
Optimized UI Interaction: Dual joystick layout for mobile landscape mode.
Left Joystick: Controls car movement (forward, backward, left, right).
Right Joystick: Controls camera gimbal rotation (up, down, left, right).
Real-time Map Display: Render the map using Leaflet or Three.js for interactive visualization.
left Joystick Auto-Centering: Automatically returns to the center when released, sending a stop command.
Right Joystick Auto-Centering: Automatically returns to the center when released, reset the angle to initial(80 and 40);
Adaptive Turning Speed: Reduces speed to 70% when turning.
Full-Screen Adaptation: Adjusts size for optimal display.
Enhanced HUD Design: Overlays speed, direction, and camera angle information.

Other important:

Frontend Development: Use Leaflet or Three.js for map visualization on the web interface.
Testing and Optimization: Conduct thorough testing to ensure low latency and high performance.
Fault Tolerance: Implement fault tolerance mechanisms for the IMU to ensure the application continues to function without crashing if hardware components are unavailable.

Video Transmission Optimization:
Reduce video resolution: Lower from 640x480 to 320x240 to reduce processing load.  
Control frame rate: Limit video output to 10-15 frames per second to avoid excessive data volume.  
Lower JPEG compression quality: Set to 60-70% quality to reduce image file size.  
Introduce frame processing control: Add frame rate control logic to the video stream generation process.
